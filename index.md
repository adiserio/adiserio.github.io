## Data Science Portfolio

Repository containing data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. 
Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks, and R markdown files.

|Analysing the Google Location History downloaded from my google account. The data provided is a .json file that can be loaded in R using the jsonlite package.| [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/adiserio/Google-Location-History) | [html](https://adiserio.github.io/Google-Location-History/AnalisisUbicacion.html)|

|**Reproducible Investigation using RMarkdown (Spanish)**| []()          | []()        |
| Goals: Ability to critically evaluate the accuracy of scientific claims and conclusions drawn by other scientists. Possibility of reproducing our works over time. For this, a precise description of the experimental procedure and subsequent analysis of the data are required, as well as careful attention to possible sources of error. | [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/adiserio/Investigacion-Reproducible)| [html](https://adiserio.github.io/Investigacion-Reproducible/SeminarioAbril.html)|
