## Data Science Portfolio

Repository containing data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. 
Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks, and R markdown files.

|**Projects**                                         |  []()            |     []()    |

|**Google Location History (GLH)**                    |  []()            |  []()       |
|Analysing the Google Location History downloaded from my google account. The data provided is a .json file that can be loaded in R using the jsonlite package.| [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/adiserio/Google-Location-History) | [html](https://adiserio.github.io/Google-Location-History/AnalisisUbicacion.html)|
|**Reproducible Investigation using RMarkdown (Spanish)**| []()          | []()        |
| Goals: Ability to critically evaluate the accuracy of scientific claims and conclusions drawn by other scientists. Possibility of reproducing our works over time. For this, a precise description of the experimental procedure and subsequent analysis of the data are required, as well as careful attention to possible sources of error. | [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/adiserio/Investigacion-Reproducible)| [html](https://adiserio.github.io/Investigacion-Reproducible/SeminarioAbril.html)|   
|**Smart Keyboard**                                   | []()             | []()        |
|The idea of this project is to build a smart keyboard that predicts the next word that might be typed by the user. In this report, first we provide major features about the dataset that will be used to build the prediction model. We analyze a large corpus of text documents to discover the structure in the data and how words are put together. Finally, we provide a summary of the plans for creating the prediction algorithm and the application. | [Rpubs](https://rpubs.com/adiserio/177267) | |
|**Search for Tweets**                                | []()             | []()        |
|Shiny App that allows you to find news and events specifying a set of words. It is possible to indicate the language used and the maximun number of tweets to be retrieved from Twitter. A word cloud and a Table are showed for the tweets that meet the specified query | [Rpubs](https://rpubs.com/adiserio/144925) | [ShinyApp](https://adiserio.shinyapps.io/SearchForTweets/)|
